Hello Everynyan! How are you? Fine, thank you! 😸  
Myself **Shanu Biswas** — part-time tech whisperer, full-time keyboard warrior. 💻⚔️

Welcome to my humble corner of the internet, where bits meet bytes,  
and sometimes crash spectacularly... for *educational purposes*, of course. 😅

Here you'll find blogposts, tutorials, and digital rants that may or may not change your life.  
(But they’ll definitely fix that one bug you’ve been ignoring for days 🐞)
